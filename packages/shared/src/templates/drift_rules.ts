Drift is a variant of Go/Baduk where after each move, the board shifts in a toroidal-like translation ("drift"). A configurable number of rows move from the bottom to the top (or vice versa if negative). The same is true for rows.
<br>
In addition to normal captures that may occur, after the drift all chains with no liberty are simultaneously removed.

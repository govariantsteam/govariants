export const rengoRulesDescription = `
Rengo is a team variant of Baduk / Go. Members of a team alternate in playing moves for their color.<br>
<br>
Here we generalised Rengo to work as a modification on top of another arbitrary (sub)variant. Every player position of the subvariant corresponds to a team of multiple players. Members of a team play moves for the corresponding player position in the subgame, and do so in a cyclic alternating order.<br>
